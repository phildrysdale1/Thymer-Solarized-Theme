# Thymer-Solarized-Theme
These themes are designed for the Thymer notes application. Designed around the [Solarized colour palette](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/).
They still need work in less obvious spots... and also with the horrible banner gradient, which I don't think we can change right now.
If you add any areas I've missed please do submit a PR or tag me in the Discord themes channel and I'll add the changes :)
